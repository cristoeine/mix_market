# MIX MARKET

---

This is my UX course project I did with my team back then when I was in university.
You can check the full version on [my figma](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/](https://www.figma.com/file/2r0d5ahfAzmbIaLP5F70Pt/Project-UX?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=LmaEM1rftGUAPfYc-1).

There are few steps to take before we make the high fidelity design of _mix market_ app.

### The Problem
At this stage, my team and I brainstormed about what was our problem in this modern and developed era. We realized that in this modern and developed era, our people also build a business, a small and medium enterprise. However, because they usually built their business at home or in a place where it is hard to reach so we are going to be their bridge, from seller to user.

### Also.. We built our icons too!
Since we want to make this project special, we built the icons, logo and many more.. you can check in the figma
