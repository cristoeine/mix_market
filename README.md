There are few steps to take before we make the high fidelity design of <em>mix market</em> app.


### The Problem

---

At this stage, my team and I brainstormed about what was our problem in this modern and developed era. We realized that in this modern and developed era, our people also build a business, a small and medium enterprise. However, because they usually built their business at home or in a place where it is hard to reach so we are going to be their bridge, from seller to user.

### Also.. We built our icons too!

---

Since we want to make this project special, we built the icons, logo and many more.. you can check in the figma
